This repo contains code for experimenting with  Grapheme-to-Phoneme (G2P) task using seq2seq models.

Requirements: Theano

A lot of boilerplate is borrowed from :https://github.com/cmusphinx/g2p-seq2seq  and seq2seq is implemented from scratch to understand the concept and test various ideas.

Current code provides 28% on testing CMU-Split.
